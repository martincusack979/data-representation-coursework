I.D:  G00239124

## Assignment 01

*Create an XML file that stores data for a library (You can create this manually, I am not asking you to create a program to do this). 
The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).  Each catalogue can contain a number of books. 
Books will have an ISBN, title and author.*

## Assignment 03

*Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json".*

## Assignment 04

*Write a program in python that will read a file from a repository. The program should then replace all the instances of the text "Andrew" with your name.
The program should then commit those changes and push the file back to the repository*
