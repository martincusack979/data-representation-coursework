## Assignment 01

*Create an XML file that stores data for a library (You can create this manually, I am not asking you to create a program to do this). 
The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).  Each catalogue can contain a number of books (say 2 for the purpose of this exercise) . 
Books will have an ISBN, title and author.*
